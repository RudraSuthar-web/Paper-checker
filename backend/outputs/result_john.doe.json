Please re-evaluate your intermediate calculations for these statistical measures."

  "remarks": "The student demonstrates a strong understanding of most statistical concepts, particularly correlation and regression analysis, performing calculations with good accuracy. Specific areas for improvement include careful verification of input values, ensuring correct interpretation of statistical measures, and rigorously applying conditions for regression line identification. With attention to these details, the student's performance can reach an excellent level."
