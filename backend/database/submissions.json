      "feedback": "The student demonstrates a fair understanding of several database concepts. Strong performance on ACID properties and log-based recovery. However, there are notable deficiencies in defining conflict serializability, providing comprehensive details for deadlock, and elaborating on query processing steps and specific heuristic rules. The unanswered question significantly impacted the overall score. More detailed study and rigor are required to improve conceptual clarity and completeness.",
